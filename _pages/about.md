Hello everyone and welcome to my blog!

My name is Andrei and I'm a CS student from Belarus who is interested in machine learning. Since I'm just a student, the goal of this blog is to make learning process more effective and trackable. In this blog I go through machine learning papers, projects that I create or take part in, cool tips and tricks that make life easier. Of course I have so much to learn and have only little experience in such a huge and growing field as ML is, so I just hope you will find something useful and enjoy reading it.
